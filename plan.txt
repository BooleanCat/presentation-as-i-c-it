Result
  Show existing ways to check failure:
  - return NULL instead of a pointer to a thing
  - return a less appropriate type to accomodate failure
  - return something like int to indicate failure
  - restrict your function to assumptions of success (e.g. strlen) or as I call it "make it someone else's problem"
  Show implementations using Result
  Show how Python represents errors
  - Any of the above +
  - Setting a global exception variable
  Show diagram of Python/quicktable border and explain how a Python exception would propagate through
  Show implementation of function that returns a Result{Type}, explain args to macros
  Show boilerplate required to register a Result{Type}

Stubbing (consider a function narrative)
  Show example function using malloc that returns an error, explain how it's difficult to force it to fail
  Explain that Linux could use __wrap to switch out the malloc at link time, but I need to support Windows, Linux, OSX
  Show macro solution that throws in the real malloc by default, show examples in tests
  Show how structs can contain function pointers to these stubbables, and the struct's "new" method will setup defaults
  Show tests that override these functions
